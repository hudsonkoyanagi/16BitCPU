# 16 Bit CPU Design

This is a kind of proof of concept project on the way to a more featureful 32-bit cpu design that I have been playing around with. It is built in [Logism Evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution).

It is a fairly simple implementatin of a custom 16-bit ISA with support for some of the most basic computer instructions including arthimetic, logic, branching and memory access.

The instruction set can be found in *isa.txt*.
